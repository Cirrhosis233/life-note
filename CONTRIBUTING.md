# Contributing to EventEdge

## Team Norms

### Team Values:
* Work Together
   * Tasks are assigned on a weekly base. Everyone is supposed to complete their work on time. 
   * When one team member encounters problems or obstacles, others should help.
* When there is a conflict we will vote among the 5 of us
  * If a group member is not delivering obligations, we will give them warnings and then notify the stakeholders
* Respond to directed messages within a day

### Sprint Cadence
* 2 weeks/sprint, each sprint the whole team should contribute approximate 25 hours/week

### Daily Standup
* 2 standups of 15 mins: Tuesday evening, Friday evening

### Coding standards
* Designate a code editor and code linter all team members will use to standardize code formatting.
* Don't over-engineer. Write minimum code to get things working end to end, only then iterate to improve. - Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the main branch of code.
* Always push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
* Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix.
* Provide descriptive commit messages.
* Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
* Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. If you see such code, delete it.
* Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality (once you learn how to do that).
## Git Workflow
* Decentralized

## A detailed description of the rules of contributing / PULL REQUEST guidelines
* Always make a PR for a feature
* Never merge PR before at least one review has been made
* With each PR, please include a description of the changes:
  * Which task/spike does the PR refer to (issue number)
  * What changes have been made
* Review other open PRs if they are not yet reviewed
* Commit titles should be of the following format: `“Add feature”`, `“Change something”` and etc.
* Make sure you format the files before opening a PR by running `npm run format`
